COMMENT_71082c38,"@[USER]  from stats from Sweden, Germany, and France I hear a different story perhaps different to where you are and I’m sure it’s difficult from country to country on how many and where they came from. Also no go zones where shariah law is upheld and big problem in London where English people are not welcomed in areas in the city. People don’t believe it’s their country any longer and that is sad no matter the country and not to be tolerated.

Another issue is the watering down or dissolution of one’s culture, traditions, and religion. Historically the people make the culture and when you change the people radically so does the culture, traditions, and religion over time. And to me I live a diametrically different life from those groups. Western Rome began a fall for the same reasons, when your everything your nothing. Historically speaking diversity is a weakness and Achilles Heel unless we are talking about enriching yourself culturally which is visiting those places and enriching your culture which historically is helpful and enriching to a culture but that’s not what’s happening here",PRCT,False,9,True,8,"@[USER]  A lot of migrants will be moving for economic reasons sure, but those from the middle-east and north africa won’t receive green cards in Sweden, nor other European countries, if they haven’t fled because of either oppression or war. So even if a lot of the interviewed migrants were to respond this way, they won’t be allowed to stay longer than five years.

On top of that, “recent migrants” only make up a very small portion of the islamic population in western european countries, the percentage of muslims has remained consistent in my country for multiple decades with there only being a slight noticeable increase (4.8 to 5.2%) when we had an influx of Syrian refugees after the outbreak of the civil war, and Syrians tend to lean towards progressive Islam. The vast majority of muslims living in the west have been here for generations and have integrated rather well ór came from (at least previously) rather progressive countries like Turkey Morocco Iraq and Iran. Yet stories like these, from recent migrants coming from more conservative regions tend to affect those populations as well with people linking those backwards cultures to religion. That’s also why I’m very opposed to this narrative.

Crime statistics have also shown a decrease of 35! in total crimes in the past decade in the Netherlands (CBS) despite the high influx of migrants, and crime rates in Sweden have remained relatively stable.",2023-02

We had way to big waves of immigration. Not enough rules and laws to ""force"" them to become part of swedish culture, also placing them all in same locations around the country. Creating communitys where immigrants only became friends with other immigrants and not becomming friend with Swedes.

A massive issue comes from natural human behavior:
-The Country has a culture, a behavior stereotype etc that is socially acceptable. 
-In to Sweden there comes hundreds of thousands of people from another cultures and are used to different behaviors. Who do not have to adjust and learn how to live properly in Sweden.
-They obviously also do not have the will to Adjust. Cause thats just how us humans are.

Sweden has laws that protects immigrants, they are not forced to learn the language, or learn to accept the culture.

Trust me, most Europeans understand exactly what he's talking about, except those who are too far gone into the leftist agenda. 


This whole thing isn't even about race or skin color or whatever in the first place. At least from our pov. It's about attitude, lack of respect for our culture, for us Europeans. I mean, look at the internet nowadays. Wherever you look, people think it's okay to talk shit about us, are racist towards us Europeans, the US or Caucasians in general. 
Also, they are trying to spread the idea that we aren't even a race. That we don't belong to a race, I mean do you think that is okay? 
That is ""Volksverhetzung"", sorry don't know the English word because I'm a racist Nazi German woman who doens't have English as their first language.
It's an attempt to dehumanize us, to make us into something not human. Dunno, may be some coping mechanism so they don't have to feel bad about what their countries are doing to us (Africa and muslim world flooding us with their losers and criminals, Asian countries infiltrating us with cheap work forces who often steal technology or spy, flooding our markets with cheap or even fake products, cyber attacks to destroy our economy and lastly Russia who's openly engaging in a genocide) or maybe it's simple and pure racism, who knows. But then, it can't be racism, because you can't be racist towards white people right? Because we don't even belong to a race. 😂

When some young African or Asian woman or dude makes a video about comparing their culture to an European or generally western one, they most often will use that chance to talk trash about us, insulting our culture as being ""savage"" compared to theirs or pick any other result (um, well we don't skin and eat animals alive, actively claiming the meat tastes better when the animal suffered before, but okay). You could make a neutral video, testing both sides and then saying you prefer your own culture in that aspect. But no. 

With all the hate, racism, infiltration, invasion, open and hidden attacks we face, it's no wonder our hospitality and tolerance will diminish over time. 
We are tired of all the anti-white propaganda all around the world, even our own governments telling us everythign is okay when our women and children are getting r*ped left and right? Our men getting robbed or killed left and right? Because the perpetrators are not from here, we have to turn a blind eye? That's disgusting.

A lot of migration move here because of the mild climate. You cannot even begin to understand how bad society becomes after 7 years of unrestricted immigration on top of 20+ years of fairly high immigration. My own neighbourhood went from being calm, crime free and clean to having multiple shoot outs between criminals every year. Several bombs have exploded in the area too. There's vandalisation going on all the time. Every week something is damaged that you use. I've had 3 break ins during a single year. Rat infestation because people stopped taking care of the garbage means i can see literal rats running across the roads when i go to the shops.

I've spoken to migrants that been collegues that live in fairly bad areas in my city and they speak of parallell societies where local groups run both policing and even ""checks"" of anyone that enters the area. One collegue couldn't even have male friends over because women aren't supposed to have male friends apparently and she had one over that later got threatened by a gang of thugs with a knife. When i picked her up one day, i had to park 2 districts down so they couldnt see the registration of my car number so they could find me later.

A country isn't just its borders and history. But the people itself is the country. If you start replacing or filling a country with people of less developed and ultimately worse morals and way of living.. then you essentially change the country for the worst. This is ultimately, despite delusions and hopes of different outcome, that this is the reality.. and it won't change.

And the politicians aren't helping.

Most of the illegals claiming asylum base on economic hardship, or violence from local gangs, will not win an asylum case. Wanting a better life for your family is not considered valid grounds. The same with legal status: You have to first become a resident which means you have to be petitioned by an immediate family member ( A Parent or sibling with a legal status in the US). Depending who petitioned you, it can be a very lengthy process, up to 26 yrs if your sibling submitted the application! Process is much faster for spouses and kids of US Citizens. Only after several years as a legal resident can you apply for Citizenship. Spouses married to US Citizens is 3 yrs, IF you know english. If you don't you might have to wait till you are 65, when you qualify for the test to be in your native language, but only if you have been a resident more than 20 yrs and so forth.

I'm all for the recognition of their culture but someone that looks mostly black or white claiming to be native american just to get benefits just seems like a shameless opportunist, and it also appears to me that the only reason why people who are less than half native american can be considered native american in the US is because the English colonizers practically genocided the north american natives to extinction and so they consider anyone that has any % of native DNA a native american just to say ""look! they're still here! we didn't kill them all!"".",Non-PRCT,True,1,True,1,"Mexicans & other central Americans are not from Spain, they are also native American.",2018-05

Actually it’s a Big Difference.,Non-PRCT,True,0,True,4,"@[USER]  I missed your earlier comment, but to be clear there are some big difference between the Ukrainians and the other group and no I don't mean race. I obviously only speak for me but what i believe most would say is that we have always been a country that accepts a certain number of slots  accept asylees and that isn't at issue. To the extent their tends to be less backlash about the Ukrainians is because we know they are all going to be valid refugees. Moreover, as a developing country with whom we have a relationship, they all also should have received some sort of background assessment as they would have had to fly to get here and in theory that means passing through security with ID.  As a developing nation that also means there's a high likelihood that most of them had some health care and education before the war and many likely also speak English so they are far less likely to be unexpectedly entering with potential diseases or finding it hard to navigate in an American work/school/community environment and since almost all will want to go home at the end of the war, we aren't buying into a lifelong subsidy with each one. Lastly and perhaps most importantly, we took in very few. I saw one number that had it under 3000 and then I saw a second that suggested it might be closer to about 15k. Even at that higher rate that amounts to something like a tenth of the numbers from Guatemala. Not for nothing. I've also never seen the Ukrainian say that there, anything, but grateful to be safe. 

By comparison the vast majority of the other migrants are illegal aliens who are gaming the asylum system. I don't think most of us are opposed to the valid asylum seekers among this group any more we are the Ukrainians but based on the number who have applied for asylum and the % of applicants who typically are approved, statistically we know that few of the non-Ukrainians fit that designation. Beyond that those other differences come in to play... that they are in vetted, that they haven't been medically screened, and the effect of the language barrier on schools... not to mention that most are looking to stay here for life, which means that we will not only be subsidizing life long through this generation, but in to the next as well based on past data. And not for nothing but many of them have spoken in a way that suggests their presence here is merely transactional, meaning they aren't refugees or asylum-seekers they just want ""a better life"" with no real gratitude or ongoing love for what in theory should be their new homeland, unlike those who come legally. Some have even suggested that they are entitled to come or who protested that we haven't given them enough  

These aren't minor differences like I said, they aren't racial or geographical, they are tangible concerns that in a way speak to the very real objections we have to these illegal aliens.

COMMENT_ed3ad673,"@[USER]  
Great Deception!
Every Christian and Muslim need to study both the Books (Bible and Quran) very carefully.

Islam depends on the words of one person, one total Stranger! The stranger who manhandled an innocent man, the Islamic prophet, at Hira cave and pressed him at least 3 times, without any provocation! 
Who was he? Did he reveal his identity or name? No, never. 
Did he claim he was angel Gabriel from God of Abraham? No, never. 
See his mysterious behavior! Even a street bully won't press an innocent man without any provocation! 

Entire Islam is based on this one person, since Allah never interacted with humanity! Allah never spoke to any human being till today. No human ever seen him! Allah remains as a character inside the pages of Quran, the book that the Stranger brought! Did Allah carry out any activity in last 1400 years? If you know anything, please share.

 Any witness for above Stranger? No, none, till today. 

1.8 billion people follow this total Stranger! Without asking any questions. From very childhood asking questions are discouraged and blind faith is instilled in young minds. 

Whereas God of Bible forewarned and foretold about this Stranger well in advance! The Stranger who will directly stand against God Almighty's saving program for sinful humanity, that is, by sending His son in order to die on the cross of Calvary. 

Now, what was the most important mission our above total Stranger of Hira cave had? 

1. Deny Jesus as Son of God Almighty. Declare boldly that Allah got no son! Declare that saying Allah got a son is the greatest sin! 

2. Deny God of Bible's second program: deny Jesus died on cross of Calvary. Say the ultimate falsehood, that some one else died on cross! 

3. In short blind the eyes of humanity to God Almighty's saving program and generate doubts about it in human mind! That is the declared mission of Islam. 

4. Stand against Ten Commandments God Almighty Himself declared on Mount Sinai! Encourage the Islamic prophet to brake the Ten Commandments!

The Stranger of Hira cave, the real person behind Islamic religion, spoke directly against what the Real angel Gabriel of Bible spoke to Mary, the future mother of Jesus Christ. See below please.
 Luke 1: 30 And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God. 31 And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. 32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, 33 and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.” 34 And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I am a virgin?” 35 And the angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy—the Son of God. 36 And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. 37 For nothing will be impossible with God.” 38 And Mary said, “Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her.

In Quran we do not know the real identity of the Stranger! Whereas Bible forewarned about him as below, well in advance! 

1 John 2: 22 Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son. 23 No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also. 24 Let what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you too will abide in the Son and in the Father. 25 And this is the promise that he made to us—eternal life. 26 I write these things to you about those who are trying to deceive you.

2 Corinthians 11: 4 For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it readily enough. 

Islam spoke about another Jesus- Issa! 

Islam spoke about yet another spirit -- the so called Jibreel, spirit of Allah!

2 Corinthians 11: 14 And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. 

John 3: 35 The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand. 36 Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.

Galatians 1:6-9 No Other Gospel 6 I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel— 7 not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. 8 But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. 9 As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed.",Non-PRCT,True,0,True,7,@[USER]  Yes.

COMMENT_a5158999,"@[USER] , Socialism doesn’t require dictators. But, there are a lot of dictators, and they’re usually not very intelligent, so they tend to destroy their economies.

In Venezuela, their dictator invested everything into oil production, and absolutely nothing in food production. Then when the United States cut off their ability to sell oil to the world, Venezuela suddenly had no source of income, and no capacity to produce food. This caused a disaster.

In Cuba, all the farmland was owned by rich Americans, and those Americans used that farmland to produce sugar, and they exploited the locals for cheap labor. The local Cuban were all poor and had zero chance of ever owning any property because it was all owned by the rich Americans. When Fidel Castro took over, he forced the rich Americans to sell their land to the Cuban government, then he gave that land to the Cuban people. This obviously upset the rich Americans who were all rich because they owned those sugar plantations in Cuba, so they sanctioned Cuba. Since the Cubans only knew how to grow sugar, and the United States wouldn’t let the sell that sugar to get money to buy food, they were forced to start doing business with the Soviet Union. This is how the United States forced Cuba to become Communist. They became communist after the United States destroyed their economy. They originally weren’t Communist and Fidel Castro originally has no intention of making Cuba Communist, and he originally didn’t want to be enemies with the United States or allies with the Soviet Union, but the United States gave him no choice.

COMMENT_f6c0c7d6,"No the ""Natives"" can not deport anyone. There was no government established here when European settlers first came and thus there were no laws. 
I love this idea that native Americans who also migrated here from Asia owned this land. 
""Ownership"" involves property and law and they had absolutely no sense of any of it. Now it would be nice for most of you if we lived in this Utopia you dream of but we do not. We live in a modern society--one where there are borders and laws to respect. 
Most people completely bypass the fact that these tribes were at constant war with one another, that they had no roads, no lasting structures and a primitive sense of establishment. 
This was free land--like it or not. It's free when you have the weapons to protect it, the money to invest in it and the resources to control it. The Europeans that came here had an abundance of all of that and those ""natives"" you speak of had virtually none. 
Every nation on earth is the product of coming, seeing and conquering. I say conquering loosely because they could be conquering a people, a landscape and a myriad of natural plagues to establish themselves--the United States had all 3. 
The Clovis people were thought to be the original inhabitants of North America and they died off long before the ""natives"" and European settlers ever got here. 
They were unbelievably bested in the fight for this soil and while a lot chose to adapt and assimilate, many did not and accepted the deals for reservation land. If they did not accept it then they would have died off continuing to fight. So then, it is their choice to continue living on these reservations which are essentially ghetto style concentration camps they have turned it into because they have such a poor economy if any at all, a sky high unemployment and suicide rate and substance abuse problems that have no end. 
So we should just give this land up to that? They would never be able to survive in the modern world without us and someone else would come here and tske it from them it is that simple.
