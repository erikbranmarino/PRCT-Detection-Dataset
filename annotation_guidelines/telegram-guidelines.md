# Annotation Guidelines for PRCT Detection in Telegram Messages

## Introduction

These guidelines are designed to assist annotators in identifying Population Replacement Conspiracy Theory (PRCT) content in Telegram messages. Due to the nature of conspiracy theories, messages often use allusions and dogwhistles rather than explicit mentions. This document provides guidance on identifying both explicit and implicit PRCT content.

## Population Replacement Conspiracy Theories (PRCT)

### Definition
The Great Replacement Theory (GRT) and related theories suggest that native populations in Western countries are being systematically replaced by non-European peoples through migration and demographic changes. These theories often:
- Vilify immigrants, especially from Muslim countries
- Blame "global Ã©lites" (EU, leftists, liberals) for orchestrating replacement
- Suggest Western culture and identity is under direct threat
- Call for action to counter supposed demographic changes

### Labels
- **Mentions, supports**: Advances or spreads the theory (explicit support not necessary)
- **Mentions, opposes**: Explicitly criticizes or counters the theory
- **Mentions, no judgment**: Neutral/journalistic mentions without endorsement
- **Does not mention**: No PRCT content present

### Common Indicators

#### Explicit References
- Great Replacement Theory
- White Genocide Theory
- Eurabia
- Kalergi Plan
- Explicit mentions of population replacement

#### Dog Whistles and Coded Language
- "White Genocide"
- "Preserving European culture"
- "Western values"
- "Protecting our borders"
- "Globalism/Globalists"
- "Invasion"
- "Replacement migration"
- "Population engineering"
- "Mass migration"
- "Reverse colonization"
- "Displacement of native populations"
- "Depopulation agenda"
- References to "Fourteen Words" or "1488"

### Important Distinctions

#### What IS PRCT Content:
- Claims of orchestrated demographic replacement
- Suggestions of deliberate population engineering
- References to specific replacement theories
- Implications of coordinated effort to change demographics
- Content positing cultural/racial purity as absolute value

#### What is NOT PRCT Content:
- General migration criticism
- Policy debates about immigration
- Discussion of demographic changes without conspiracy elements
- Border security concerns
- Economic impact analysis

## Annotation Process

1. **Read the Full Message**
   - Consider complete context
   - Look for both explicit and implicit references
   - Check for coded language or dog whistles

2. **Consider Multiple Elements**
   - Direct theory mentions
   - Use of known dog whistles
   - Implications of orchestrated replacement
   - References to demographic conspiracy

3. **Make the Final Decision**
   - If clear support/opposition: use appropriate label
   - If mentions without judgment: use neutral label
   - If unclear: default to "does not mention"

## Examples

### PRCT Content (Mentions, supports):
```
"The Kalergi plan is in full effect - they're replacing us day by day!"

"White birth rates dropping while migration increases... coincidence? The globalists know exactly what they're doing."

"Another city lost to the invasion. This is all part of their plan to destroy our culture."
```

### Non-PRCT Content:
```
"Immigration numbers have increased by 20% this year."

"We need better border control policies."

"Current immigration system needs reform."
```

### Borderline Cases
Consider the broader context and patterns when evaluating messages that:
- Use migration statistics without explicit conspiracy claims
- Discuss demographic changes neutrally
- Critique immigration policies without conspiracy elements

## Language Considerations

The dataset includes content in multiple languages (PT, NL, ES, IT, EN). Key considerations:
- Dog whistles may vary by language/culture
- Some terms have different connotations in different languages
- Consider local political and social context

## Special Notes

1. **Critical Mentions**: Even academic or critical discussions of PRCT should be labeled as "mentions" (with appropriate stance)

2. **Implicit References**: Messages may support PRCT without explicitly stating the full theory

3. **Context Matters**: Consider the broader conversation and channel context when unclear

4. **Mixed Content**: If a message contains both PRCT and non-PRCT elements, label based on PRCT presence
